# Title

JavaScript Realms - The Blank Spot In Web Application Runtime Security

# Description (Long)

Due to the rise of dependencies based development, the JavaScript ecosystem (and the browser JavaScript ecosystem in particular) is far more vulnerable to the rising major problem we know as “supply chain attacks”.

Therefore, many different supply chain security solutions were introduced to the industry as well, focusing on different ends of it, ranging from build time to runtime protection.

However, runtime browser based protections usually lack a major component in their solutions, one that mostly leaves such solutions completely vulnerable, almost as if they were never there.

Realms (aka iframes in the browser) is an ancient and legitimate concept that goes through a horrific spinoff in the context of bypassing browser based supply chain security attempts.

And the worst part is that carrying out attacks is so easy with realms, but defending realms is so complicated.

It's time to dive into the so important yet ignored layer in securing against unwanted code execution - it's time to talk about the JavaScript realms blank spot and its offensive/defensive security aspects.

In this talk we'll understand what realms are, why they are so easily abused to bypass protections, why they are such an important and unregarded layer to secure and we'll also introduce SnowJS - the most advanced open source software for securing JavaScript realms.

It's time we stop being terrorized by iframes!

# Description (Short)

The rise of dependencies in JavaScript development has increased vulnerability to supply chain attacks, particularly in the browser ecosystem. 

Existing security solutions often neglect a crucial component, leaving them ineffective. 

This talk focuses on securing against unwanted code execution by addressing the overlooked layer of JavaScript realms. 

We will explore the abuse potential, the importance of securing realms, and introduce SnowJS, an advanced open-source solution. 

It's time we stop being terrorized by iframes!
